# Creating a Supply Chain Blockchain in Python

This thesis project explores the application of blockchain technology to create a transparent and secure record of transactions within a supply chain. The `Blockchain` class, implemented in Python, facilitates the tracking of goods from order placement through to delivery.

# Objectives
- To demonstrate how blockchain can improve transparency in supply chain management.
- To provide a proof-of-concept for tracking items through various stages of a supply chain.

# Implementation
The project includes a Python-based blockchain that allows for:
- Creation of blocks to represent transactions.
- Addition of transactions with timestamps and relevant supply chain data.
- A proof-of-work algorithm to validate new blocks.
 

# Features
- `add_new_transaction(xml_transaction)`: Method to add a new XML-formatted transaction to the list of unconfirmed transactions.
- `mine()`: Method to mine a new block with all unconfirmed transactions.
- `compute_hash()`: Instance method to create a SHA-256 hash of a block.
- `proof_of_work(block)`: Method that implements the proof-of-work algorithm to validate the mining of a new block.


## Detailed Documentation on Digital Product Passports (DPP)

### Definition and Purpose
Digital Product Passports (DPPs) are digital records that store detailed information about the lifecycle of a product, including manufacturing, transportation, and environmental impact data. They enhance transparency and accountability in supply chains by providing a single source of truth.

### Implementation Guide
1. **Setup**: Implement the data structure for DPPs within the blockchain.
2. **Data Ingestion**: Capture data at each stage of the supply chain and add it to the DPP.
3. **Integration**: Ensure DPP data is immutable and accessible through the blockchain.

### Use Cases
- **Raw Material Sourcing**: Track emissions from extraction and processing.
- **Manufacturing Process**: Monitor energy usage and waste generation.
- **Distribution and Retail**: Optimize transportation routes to reduce emissions.
- **End-of-Life Management**: Facilitate recycling and proper disposal.

****How to Use****

To interact with the blockchain, instantiate the `Blockchain` class and use its methods to add transactions and mine new blocks.

****Adding a Transaction****

blockchain.add_new_transaction(xml_transaction_data)

****Mining a Block****

blockchain.mine()

****Running the Tests****

Ensure the integrity of the blockchain functionality by running the unit tests provided in the test_blockchain.py file.

python -m unittest test_blockchain.py
